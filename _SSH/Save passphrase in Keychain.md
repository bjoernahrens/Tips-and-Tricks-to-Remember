subtitle: Save passphrase for SSH in Keychain
---

If a `config` file does not exist yet, create a new one (at `~/.ssh/config`).

Add one of the following to the `config` file:

- For example, if you are trying to do this for GitHub:

  ```
  Host github.com
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_github_cert_rsa
      UseKeychain yes
  ```

- If you want to enable it for every host, just add:

  ```
  Host *
      UseKeychain yes
  ```
