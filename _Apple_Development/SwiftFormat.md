More info on [GitHub/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)

There is a command line tool for formatting swift files through the terminal. Simply install it via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install swiftformat
```

## Xcode Source Editor Extension

You can also easily add it to Xcode as an extension. First, install it via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask swiftformat-for-xcode
```

After installing it, open it and follow the instructions to add the tool to Xcode.
In Xcode, you will find the tool under the 'Editor' section in the menu bar at the very bottom with the three commands:

- Format Selection
- Format File
- Lint File

As a bonus tip, you can add a key combo in the Xcode settings under 'Key Bindings', e.g. `⌥⌘L`.
