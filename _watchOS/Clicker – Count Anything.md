## Features

Count anything on your watch:

- Laps while exercising

- Days since you quit smoking

- Number of people in your club

- How much weight you've lost

- Sheep

Tapping anywhere on your watch face adds to your counter and gives you haptic feedback. You don't have to stare at your wrist while counting!

Includes a watch complication that lets you easily check and access the counter.

To decrement or clear the counter, force press on your watch face.

Records up to 2,147,483,647 taps. Knock yourself out.
